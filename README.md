# This is a public repo to access all the ADT files for the Data Structures Lab for Semester III

All the ADT files for different data structres are given as header files.  
Include the header files in the testDriver.c file to test it out or run an application.

## ADT Specific Notes
    + The header node of the linked lists are empty and hold no value.
    + The init() function should be called after initialization of the stack to initialize the top and size values.
